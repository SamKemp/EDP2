# EDP2
The repo for my EDP2 assignment.


Features:
- A display for the players score

- A check for the players guess and compare it against the answer
 - If the guess is correct add 10 to the score
 - If the guess is wrong move onto the next question
- The game will end after 60 seconds or when all turns have been passed
- At the end of the game the players final score is displayed
- If all answers are answered correctly then 40 points are added
- If all answers are correct and time is remaining then add one point for each second
